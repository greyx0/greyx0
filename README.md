# ABOUT ME

Hello there! My name is Grey Combattelli. I am a transmasculine, bisexual and polyamorous person. 
I'm a avid gamer and I've been passionate about games and their making process for as long as I can remember, so I decided to persue my passion and interest and go to TheSign Academy to study Game Design. I also write as a hobby, feel free to check some of my work below.
