# ABOUT ME

Hello there! My name is G. Victor Renoux.
I've been passionate about games and their making process for as long as I can remember, so I decided to persue my passion and interest and go to TheSign Academy to study Game Design.
I'll be using Github for all repos of my personal and professional project, so feel free to have a look around!
